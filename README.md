# Express Routing Exercise

Try your hand at routing with Express!

## Setup

```bash
#install dependencies
npm install
#start the service
npm start
```

You should then be able to point your browser to http://localhost:3000/hello/world and get a friendly response.

## Exercise

Add routes that do the following:

1. Accept `apple` or `ale`, returning `"Apple or Ale?"`.
1. Accept the word `whoa` with an aribitrary number of `o`s and `a`s, returning `"I know, right?!"`.
1. Take a first name and last name as parameters, returning a greeting for that user.
1. Take a word as a parameter and returning the word reversed.
1. Add a route that will execute if nothing else is matched, returning `"Uh oh!"`.
